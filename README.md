# AI Diagnostic and Prescription Assistant

An AI-powered digital assistant for disease diagnosis and medication prescription.

## Project Overview

This system uses artificial intelligence to analyze patient symptoms, predict potential diseases, and recommend appropriate medications with dosage guidelines. It's designed to assist healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions.

## Key Features

- Symptom analysis and disease prediction using AI/ML
- Medication recommendation with dosage guidelines
- User-friendly interfaces for patients and healthcare providers
- Comprehensive safety and compliance mechanisms
- Data privacy and security measures
- Integration capabilities with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems
- Feedback collection and system improvement mechanisms
