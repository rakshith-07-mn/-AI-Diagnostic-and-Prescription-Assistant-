# User Interface Design for AI Diagnostic and Prescription Assistant

This document outlines the user interface design for the AI Diagnostic and Prescription Assistant, focusing on symptom input and result presentation for both patients and healthcare providers.

## 1. Overview

The user interface is designed with two primary user personas in mind:
1. **Patients**: Individuals seeking diagnostic assistance and medication recommendations
2. **Healthcare Providers**: Clinicians using the system as a decision support tool

The interface prioritizes clarity, accessibility, and a guided experience while maintaining medical accuracy and appropriate disclosure of system limitations.

- **Guidance**: Structured flow that guides users through the process
- **Safety**: Prominent safety notices and emergency guidance
- **Responsiveness**: Adaptive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### 2.2 Visual Language

- **Color Scheme**: Calming blues and greens with high contrast for readability
- **Typography**: Clear, legible fonts with appropriate hierarchy
- **Iconography**: Consistent, intuitive icons with text labels
- **White Space**: Generous spacing to reduce cognitive load
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between primary and secondary information
